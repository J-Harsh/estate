The project was made using react,tailwind Css, material ui and context api.
I wanted to custom make every component but because of health reasons and lack of time was not able to, thus resorted to using material ui.
This portrays my ability to work with both material ui and tailwind css.

The use of context-api was to not go through the route of prop drilling, as I like my components separated.
The use of context-api brought along challenges of itself which I was able to comfortably handle.
